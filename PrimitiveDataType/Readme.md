# Main difference between Primitive and Non-primitive:

i>Primitive data types hold the actual value of a variable. Non-primitive data types hold the memory location/address of the value of a variable.
ii>Primitive value cannot be changed (Immutable), Non-primitive data type value can be changed.
iii>Primitive data types are stored by value and Non-primitive data types are stored by reference.
