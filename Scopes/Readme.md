Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript.

There are two types of scopes:-
1>Local scope
i>Block scope
ii>Functional Scope
2>Global Scope

-> let and const provides block level scopes which means that the variables declared inside a { }, can not be accessed from outside of the block.

eg:-
{
let a=25;
//we can only access a here.
}

//a cant be access here.

-> Variable
