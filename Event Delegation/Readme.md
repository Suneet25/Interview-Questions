Event delegation refers to the process of using event propagation (bubbling) to handle events at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated. It allows us to attach a single event listener for elements that exist now or in the future.

What are the benefits of event delegation?
Benefits: Simplifies initialization and saves memory: no need to add many handlers. Less code: when adding or removing elements, no need to add/remove handlers. DOM modifications: we can mass add/remove elements with innerHTML and the like.
